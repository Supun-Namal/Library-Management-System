A simple C# project designed as a first-time learning exercise. This Library Management System provides a basic interface for managing books and students without a database.

* Issue Books: Record book issuance with student details and due dates. 
* Return Books: Track returned books and generate reports. 
* File-Based Data: Stores and retrieves data from files instead of a database.
